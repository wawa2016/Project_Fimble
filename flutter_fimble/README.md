### Statistics Page

This page will display the settings of temperature control of the storage area. It is useful especially for sensitive food items which need to be stored at a certain temperature. A breakdown of the category of the items can also be derived via analytics from all the data gathered through this smart inventory system.

### Overview Page

The overview page is useful for large inventories especially in warehouses. By providing visual icon representation of the storage area, the workers in a warehouse can quickly navigate and find the item they are looking for.
